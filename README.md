# BMU-Verification

## Last Update:

- #### **The `main branch` represents the version of the project that implements my solution to the synchronization problem, by adding a delay in the driver and the monitor.(I added 2clock cycles for both of the driver and the monitor)**

- #### **The branch `with_sync_problem` represents a version of the project that has a synchronization problem (It's the Normal Behavior of the DUT). The result of the operands are shown one cycle later than the operands themselves.**
